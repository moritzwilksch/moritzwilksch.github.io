## Hey!
I'm Moritz Wilksch. A master student of Business Informatics in Potsdam (Germany), specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning. 
I'm also a fan of blog-style Data Science tutorials compared to pay-walled Medium articles or lengthy YouTube videos. This is why I started this blog.
A little bit of concepts, code and math about different Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms and ideas.
